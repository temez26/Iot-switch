# Button Control Project 🕹️

Welcome to the Button Control project! This project is all about controlling a button's state using a PHP backend and JavaScript frontend. The button can be toggled between two states: "On" and "Off".

## Features 🚀

- **Toggle Button**: A button on the frontend that can be toggled between "On" and "Off" states.
- **Server Communication**: The frontend communicates with a PHP backend to get and set the button state.
- **Database Connection**: The PHP backend connects to a MariaDB database to store the button state.
